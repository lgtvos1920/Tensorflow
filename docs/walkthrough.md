# Walkthrough - Final Refined Model Integration & Security Audit

This document walks through the final integration steps completed on the `release-candidate-v2` branch, including merging the integration branch, resolving warnings, executing the 19 combined tests, verifying clean clone execution, and stopping background servers.

## 🔒 Security & PII Audit

In compliance with strict security policies (modeled after Microsoft and Amazon standards), we audited our repository and dashboard for potential vulnerabilities:

1. **PII Collection Mitigation**:
   - **Action**: We removed the "Reviewer Signature (Name)" text input block from the sidebar/dashboard to prevent capturing Personal Identifiable Information (PII) on disk or logs.
   - **Replacement**: Substituted with a transient, non-identifying checkbox acknowledgment: *"I acknowledge that I have reviewed the prediction trajectory and confirm receipt of the maintenance recommendation."*
   
2. **Explicit Offline & Error Fail-Safes**:
   - The dashboard operates purely on real predictions via the FastAPI backend and never silently falls back to synthetic predictions if the server is offline or the model is missing.
   - If the FastAPI gateway is offline, the dashboard displays a clear red connection status: `API Gateway: Disconnected` and blocks all analytics panels.
   - If the model artifacts are missing on the backend, the API health endpoint reports `model_loaded: false`, and `/predict/rul` and `/model-info` throw explicit `503 Service Unavailable` responses, which are caught and reported as distinct error notifications on the dashboard.

## ⚠️ Dependency & Warnings Analysis

We analyzed all Python warnings generated during execution. We resolved all warnings at their source:

### 1. Resolved Warnings
- **Scikit-Learn Version Compatibility**:
  - *Warning*: `InconsistentVersionWarning` (estimators unpickled from version 1.8.0 when using 1.5.0).
  - *Resolution*: Upgraded `scikit-learn` in `requirements.txt` to `1.8.0` matching Member A's training pipeline exactly. All compatibility warnings are fully resolved.
- **Model Feature Mismatch Warning**:
  - *Warning*: `UserWarning: X has feature names, but RandomForestRegressor was fitted without feature names`.
  - *Resolution*: Modified `src/predict.py` to pass the pandas DataFrame `X_df` to the `StandardScaler` (which expects names) and pass raw numpy values `X_df.values` to the `RandomForestRegressor` (which was fitted without names).
- **Starlette python-multipart warning**:
  - *Warning*: `PendingDeprecationWarning: Please use import python_multipart instead`.
  - *Resolution*: Pinned `python-multipart==0.0.9`, fully resolving the deprecation warning with current FastAPI-Starlette packages.

## 🧪 Verification & Automated Tests

### 1. Unified Pytest Suite
We ran the combined test suite of all 19 test cases. **All 19 tests passed successfully with 0 warnings.**

```bash

### 2. Clean Clone Verification
We ran the clean clone script `src/test_clean_clone.py`. It successfully cloned the repository into an isolated temporary folder and executed predictions warning-free:
```bash
1. Cloning repository into isolated environment: C:\Users\RDP\AppData\Local\Temp\1\tmpqt2p3_6t\repo
2. Executing predict_rul() inside clean clone...
Stdout:

## 🏃 Active Background Services

All background validation services have been successfully stopped after manual testing and validation, to ensure no running background tasks remain active post-deployment.
